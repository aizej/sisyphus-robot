A simulated robot in WEBOTS learns how to push a ball up the hill using PPO

Recently I had an idea to make Ai recreate the recent Sisyphus meme so I searched for a robotic simulation program that could run on my PC (not isac-sim) and I found WEBOTS.
It's free and it has built-in robot and environment building options. Plus it also has good integration with python.
